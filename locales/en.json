  "catalog_title": "Catalog App",
  "catalog_text_1": "In the summer of 2020, I wrote a smartphone app for collaborative digital management and resolution of a household.",
  "catalog_text_2": "The main purpose of the app was to determine which items someone would actually still like to have and which could be sold or disposed of. For this purpose, all utility items, furniture and other furnishings were added to the catalog and then everyone could select which parts they were still interested in. In this way, a list of all items is finally obtained, with an indication of who would like to take it.",
  "catalog_text_3": "Another function was to be able to compactly store the furnishings without losing track of where each item was located. For this purpose, the number of the box or shelf in which an item was placed could be entered. In addition, each item was assigned a sequential unique number.",
  "catalog_text_4": "Via the search function, items can be searched by keyword, type (decoration, furniture, ...) or by their original location (kitchen, living room, ...). Using the part number and the number of the shelf or box, they can then be found quickly. To this day, I regularly search and find things via this app.",

  "visualization_title": "Live Data Visualization",
  "visualization_text_1": "Effective and intuitive visualization contributes enormously to the understanding of data. As part of my master's thesis, I developed, among other things, a web-based tool for visualizing the analysis results from a geostatistical analysis of spatiotemporal autocorrelation in geodata streams. This tool contains a histogram with results from permutation tests for an indicator value for the autocorrelation as well as a so-called Moran scatterplot to visualize the shape of the measured autocorrelation. Next to it there is a map of the study area (New York City). In this map, the different districts are colored according to the local strength of the autocorrelation.",
  "visualization_text_2": "Such a presentation with dynamic and interactive diagrams and maps, allows for a quick understanding of the data. Especially since the results shown from the analysis change quickly, this visualization makes it easy to see the evolution of the autocorrelation. This adaptation of the original tool is designed as a visual example. The control buttons can be used to mimic the playback of different time windows of the analysis. Originally, the new analysis results were transferred directly to the diagrams via a websocket and thus constantly updated.",

  "wood_working_title": "Wood working",
  "wood_working_text": "In my free time I like to retreat to my small workshop in the basement. Here, I mainly create smaller furniture or wooden decorations. Last year I also dedicated myself to building my own kitchen. The practical work on small DIY projects is always a lot of fun for me and is a great balance to the work at the desk. I've compiled a few of the resulting pieces and projects in the photo series below.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_christmas": "Winter and Christmas Decorations",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_schneemann_1": "This snowman was sawed from a leftover piece of spruce wood. A couple of painted lenses serve as buttons and eyes, and a brass screw serves as the nose.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_schneemann_2": "On these different snowmen you can see well the difference between sawn (left and right) and turned (center) figures.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_tannen_1": "These small firs were also made on the bandsaw. Afterwards they were still treated with different colored wood waxes.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_tannen_2": "These small firs were made from spruce wood scraps.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_tannen_altholz_4": "After finding no use for four pieces of scrap wood of about the same size, I decided in the winter of 2020 to make three decorative firs out of them. In each of the firs you can find a piece of the four different woods.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_tanne_licht_1": "This fir was made from a remnant of a spruce rafter. The lights used are from a simple string of lights.",
  "wood_working_description_christmas_tanne_licht_2": "This fir was also once a section of a rafter. Because of the wider shape, the lights here are arranged more like a classic arch of lights.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_klavier": "Piano",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_1": "This old piano was unfortunately no longer playable and usable as a musical instrument. However, as a piece of furniture it was still promising. Then I had the idea to convert the case into a showcase for glasses and all kinds of other things. As you can see on this picture, I first removed the vice and the mechanics...",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_2": "After that I could start to rebuild the inside. To do this, I lined the inside walls with fabric from my roommate's old curtains and fitted a multiplex board as a floorboard.",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_3": "In addition, I then added a smaller false floor in the upper area. In this area, the intermediate floor is not visible through the windows. Also, it's wonderful to put smaller things here and you can get to it directly through the top flap.",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_4": "I kept the old keyboard as much as possible and installed it again. On the one hand, it looks very nice and on the other hand, there is still the possibility for the future to convert the old keyboard to a digital midi keyboard. That will be a separate project.",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_5": "This is how the piano looked almost finished. In this photo, however, the glass panels are still missing. The front is adapted so that it can be folded out completely above the keyboard. So you can then also get to the glasses inside.",
  "wood_working_description_klavier_6": "This photo was taken in my room in Studienrendenwohnheim. Here you can also see the LEDs that are embedded in the false floor.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_vogelhaus": "Bird house",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_1": "In the summer of 2021, I set out to build a birdhouse for the balcony. The goal was a classic birdhouse with a gable roof and branches as cladding.",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_2": "In the first step I made the roof from spruce wood and faced the gables with two branches sawn lengthwise.",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_3": "After that could then come the supporting structure. To do this, four sections of branches were cut at the right angle and glued to the roof and base plate with wooden dowels.",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_4": "In the third step, the walls were then added from two branch sections per side.",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_5": "To last still the roof covering had to be applied. For this I glued many no and as straight as possible branches on the surface. Then I filled in the gaps with chopped branches.",
  "wood_working_description_vogelhaus_6": "And with that the birdhouse was already finished. A titmouse has already found its way here. In winter, the birdhouse was exceedingly well visited by blackbirds and titmice.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_kueche": "Kitchen",
  "wood_working_description_kueche_1": "In the fall of 2022, when I moved to Aachen I faced the problem that my apartment had no kitchen. So I decided to build the kitchen myself. So I could design splitting also exactly according to my wishes. Especially important to me was an extra deep countertop with 80 cm depth. In the middle area I wanted no upper cabinets, so that the entire kitchen still remains as airy as possible and does not visually bludgeon you. I also placed the washing machine and dryer on the right side.",
  "wood_working_description_kueche_2": "First I built the base cabinets. They are extra deep because of the large countertop. In the back, the base cabinet is set back to match the countertop so the window still opens. You can also see in this photo that the countertop is slightly higher than standard kitchens. This really benefits my back and makes cooking so much more fun.",
  "wood_working_description_kueche_3": "Here you can already see the countertop lying on the base cabinets. The top is made of light birch wood and with was oiled and not painted. This gives a nice natural look.",
  "wood_working_description_kueche_4": "And so the whole thing looked finished. Here are a few small shelves added, you also made the cutouts for hob and Süle. Also the wall units are there now and all the cabinets got doors and drawers.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_schleif": "Double sander",
  "wood_working_description_schleif_1": "Here I once built adjustable rests for a double grinder. The small rests can be adjusted both in angle of inclination and distance to the sander. So it will be much easier to position different tools and other metal parts here.",
  "wood_working_description_schleif_2": "The supports are attached with simple wing nuts and can thus be easily moved.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_pumpe": "Old water pump",
  "wood_working_description_pumpe_1": "This old pump was after many years without maintenance in a bad condition and also no longer pumped water. As a small repair project, I refurbished the pump over the winter and was then able to pump water up with it again in the summer.",
  "wood_working_description_pumpe_2": "First, the piston with the float in it had to be unscrewed and derusted. After several decades in wind and weather, this was quite difficult.",
  "wood_working_description_pumpe_3": "After the steel parts were clean again, I was able to replace the leather seal and the moving parts inside the pump were ready for use again.",
  "wood_working_description_pumpe_4": "The inner wall was also heavily rusted. Since the leather seal runs over here and has to close tightly to pump water, some work had to be done here. First I treated the whole housing with citric acid. Afterwards I brushed the cylinder with a soft wire brush again bright and smooth.",
  "wood_working_subtitle_weitere": "Other Projects",
  "wood_working_description_weitere_1": "Here I once made a fireplace for barbecue charcoal from a piece of sheet metal and a remnant of beech wood.",
  "wood_working_description_weitere_2": "This small table made of beech wood can be folded together to save space. Ideal in my small student apartment at the time.",
  "wood_working_description_weitere_3": "This small bicycle trailer is super practical for fetching bulky things from the hardware store.",

  "energy_monitoring_title": "Energy monitoring",
  "energy_monitoring_text_1": "I gained experience in the field of energy monitoring mainly through my student assistant jobs at the Chair of Energy Efficient Construction at RWTH Aachen University. In my first job in this field (from March 2017 to November 2018), my tasks were the maintenance and further development of an existing monitoring system in the context of a long-term energy monitoring of a residential building complex in Neu-Ulm. This monitoring system included server systems for storage, management and analysis of monitoring data. In my second job (from December 2018 to July 2020), I worked on the development and operation of a facade testing stand and related measurement technology in the context of a non-destructive analysis of wall constructions. Here, my tasks included helping to develop and set up the testing stand, as well as developing equipment for measuring surface temperatures. The programming of an automatic data logger for the temperature sensors was also part of this.",
  "energy_monitoring_text_2": "I also wrote my bachelor thesis in the field of energy monitoring in 2017. The topic of the thesis was the \" Development of an M-Bus-based measurement network for the application in 'energy monitoring'\". In this context, I developed a data logger for automated reading of smart electricity meters. This data logger was realized with a single board computer and using freely available software. The data logger controlled a network of several intelligent electricity meters via the M-BUS protocol and read them out automatically.",
  "energy_monitoring_text_3": "In this context, I have also developed a methodology for the automatic configuration of smart electricity meters via the M-BUS protocol, which allows a much faster and more efficient retrieval of monitoring data from such meters. I was also able to give a presentation about this at the Forum for building informatics in 2017.",

  "gis_title": "Geoinformation systems",
  "gis_text_1": "Geoinformationssysteme sind Computersysteme zur Erfassung, Verwaltung, Analyse und Visualisierung geografischer Daten (Geodaten). Meine Faszination für Geodaten und deren digitale Verarbeitung entstand im Laufe meines Masterstudiums, als ich in verschiedenen Lehrveranstaltungen Einblicke in diese Thematik bekam. In meiner Zeit als studentische Hilfskraft am Geodätischen Institut und Lehrstuhl für Bauinformatik & Geoinformationssysteme der RWTH Aachen (von September 2020 bis September 2021) konnte ich viele spannende Erfragungen sammeln und habe ein besonderes Interesse an webbasierten Geoinformationssystemen (Web-GIS) entwickelt. Ich habe dort am Projekt OpenGeoResearch mitgearbeitet und dabei zunächst vor allem die Smartphone-App für das Projekt entwickelt. OpenGeoResearch war ein Projekt innerhalb der Wissenschaftsjahres 2022 initiiert vom Bildungsministerium für Bildung und Forschung und hatte zum Ziel eine partizipative Plattform für wissenschaftliche raumbezogene Fragestellungen zu entwickeln. ",
  "gis_text_2": "Nach dem ich ab November 2022 als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Geodätischen Institut und Lehrstuhl für Bauinformatik & Geoinformationssysteme der RWTH Aachen gearbeitet habe, habe ich neben der Smartphone App auch das Geoportal und die Backend-Systeme und Datenbanken von OpenGeoResearch weiterentwickelt und im Sommer 2022 das Projekt selbst koordiniert. Im Rahmen dieses Projekts konnte ich auch interessante Einblicke in die Citizen Science bekommen. In der Citizen Science werden Menschen in die Forschung einbezogen, welche in den jeweiligen wissenschaftlichen Bereichen nicht selbst arbeiten. Durch diesen Einbezug von interessierten Menschen aus der Bevölkerung können große Datenmengen in der Realwelt gesammelt werden. Es können aber auch neue wissenschaftliche Fragestellungen durch die Partizipation der Bevölkerung am wissenschaftlichen Prozess entstehen. In diesem Zusammenhang habe ich verschiedene Vorträge auf der FOSSGIS-Konferenz 2022, dem Forum Citizen Science 2022 und der ECSA Conference 2022 gehalten. Nach Abschluss von OpenGeoResearch habe ich noch an mehreren anderen spannenden GIS-Projekten gearbeitet.",
